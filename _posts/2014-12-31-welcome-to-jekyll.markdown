Globalization drives the culture of fast fashion. Currently, there is also a lightly different drive to promote the idea of transitioning to slow fashion.<!--more--> However, this gradual shift requires time, measured not in months or years but in decades or generations. Recycling and remanufacturing which do not equate with models in nature always lead to a question mark. Therefore, a different approach to address the challenges facing sustainable fashion is absolutely necessary. We suggest the shift should be directed towards nature. We must try and discover the mechanisms that drive nature’s incessant creation of organisms without piling up mountains of waste. Researchers have already begun the study of biodegradation, mineralization and biomass formation, which is nature’s way of creating zero waste. Discovery of the laws of zero waste in nature could then be mimicked in the production of fast-compostable textile fibres.
