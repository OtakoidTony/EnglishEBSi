Of greater importance than the slight reduction in gravity’s pull is the so-called thin air that is ① present at high altitudes. Although air contains the same proportions of oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases at high altitudes as at sea level, in a similar volume of air there is ② less of each the higher up in altitude you go. This characteristic greatly affected athletes who competed in the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, which is 7,350 ft (2,240 m) above sea level. In Mexico City, athletes had to breathe more vigorously and more ③ often to get the oxygen they needed. This caused a serious problem for athletes in endurance events, but it ④ assisted athletes in short sprints because they ran on their bodies’ stored energy supplies. When Bob Beamon set his world record in the long jump in Mexico City, he ⑤ suffered from a slight reduction in gravity, reduced air resistance from less dense air, and the fact that his approach was a short sprint and not a distance run.
