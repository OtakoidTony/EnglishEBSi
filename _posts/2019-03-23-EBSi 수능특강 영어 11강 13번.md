According to evolutionary biologist Elisabet Sahtouris, cooperation is the only way toward sustainability. ① Mature ecosystems such as prairies and rainforests evolve when there is more cooperation than when there is hostile competition. ②The highly complex ecosystem of the rainforest is a particularly vivid example of a mature system that has survived through millions of years because species learned to cooperate with each other. ~~③ Deforestation comes in many forms, including fires, clear-cutting for agriculture, unsustainable logging for timber, and degradation due to climate change.~~ ④ In the rainforest, every species is fully employed, all work cooperatively while recycling all of their resources, and all products and services are distributed in such a way that every species remains healthy. ⑤ That is sustainability. 
 prairie 대초원 Customers like e-mail because it's easy to use and it gives them immediate access to organizations. Most of the time, customers receive an automated response indicating that their e-mail has been received and stating when they can expect to get a response. However, even automated responses need to be phrased appropriately. Some years ago, a clothing company used to send out an automated reply that read, “While we cannot get back to you personally, we do appreciate your input.” That response didn't provide much satisfaction or a feeling of connectivity. Researchers Judy Strauss and Donna Hill, in one of the first major studies covering consumer complaints sent by e-mail, found that less than half (47%) of the firms studied created higher customer satisfaction with their in-kind e-mail responses. They found that simple things make a difference. This included a fast response, an e-mail that addressed the specific problem, and an e-mail that was signed with a real person’s name.

> 진화생물학자, Elisabet Sahtouris에 따르면 협력은 지속가능성을 지닌 유일한 방법이라고 한다. 초원이나 열대우림과 같은 대자연 생태계는 적대적인 경쟁이 발생할 때 보다 협력을 할 때 더욱 진화를 한다. 열대우림의 높은 수준의 복잡생태계는 종들은 서로 돕는 법을 배웠기 때문에 수백년 넘게 살아남을 수 있다는 매우 생생한 예가 있다. ~~그러나 열대우림의 파괴는 대형화재, 완전벌목, 유지불능 목재 사용 및 변화시키려는 행위를 포함해 다양한 방식으로 다가올 것이다.~~
