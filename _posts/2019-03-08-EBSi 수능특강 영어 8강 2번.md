## 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?


Have you ever been to an event and ①<u>had</u> someone else’s reaction make you feel totally out of place? At the beginning of the evening you felt spectacular, but one strange look or slight awkward laugh made you feel ②<u>that</u> you had committed a fashion sin. Who hasn’t been in that position? One person, looking us up and down, makes us feel smaller for having what we have and dressing in what we wear. If this person is willing to judge others so ③<u>harshly</u>, though, imagine how often she judges herself. If you know who you are, such a person will not be able to tear you down by simply ④<u>projecting</u> her insecurity onto you. You will never feel the need to win the affection of such a person if you are content with ⑤<u>which</u> you have under your clothes and under your skin.
