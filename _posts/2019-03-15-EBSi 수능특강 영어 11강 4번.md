By the end of the millennium, emotions had become such a central part of psychology’s focus that many scholars viewed emotions as the motivational force guiding almost all of human behavior. Today, many psychological scientists agree that any decision we make, any relationship we pursue, any thing we want — all these judgments, behaviors, and desires are influenced by emotion. Even those decisions which, we believe, are shaped by rationality or logical principles about what is right or good are in fact more often triggered by a gut emotional response. We tell ourselves that such decisions aren’t driven by our emotions, and that we are relying on the mind’s most sophisticated reasoning processes, but research shows that we are very good at coming up with “sophisticated” reasons to justify what we want to think, and what we want to think is almost always shaped by how we feel.
