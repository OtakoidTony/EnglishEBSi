## 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 <u>않은</u> 것은? 
Loneliness and lack of self-esteem are among the most obvious conditions which can be alleviated[^1] by living with an animal friend. You are never alone with a dog or cat: walking the dog brings you into contact with other people and makes it infinitely ①<u>easier</u> to strike up a conversation with strangers. Local cat owners often get to know one another too, as it is ② <u>common</u> for cats to wander into their neighbours’ gardens (and houses!) and for neighbours to exchange cat-sitting duties during holiday times. Having the responsibility for a pet can ③<u>increase</u> your sense of your own value and importance. Caring for an animal reminds you that however low you might feel, you are ④<u>capable</u>. When you’re tempted to stay in bed and pull the covers over your head, you have to get up and feed the cat or walk the dog. That everyday routine with a creature who needs you can be extremely ⑤<u>annoying</u>. 

[^1]: alleviate 완화시키다, 경감시키다
