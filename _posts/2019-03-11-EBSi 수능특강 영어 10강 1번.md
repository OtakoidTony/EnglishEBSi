## 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 <u>다른</u> 것은? 

Tim Wallach, the third baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers, was ready to hang it up. Once a great hitter, ① <u>he</u> had been batting poorly for two consecutive seasons. But Reggie Smith, a first-year batting coach on the team, wouldn’t let Wallach quit. He encouraged him and told him that ② <u>he</u> could get his “stroke” back with a little extra work. So during the off-season, Smith worked with ③ <u>him</u> three times a week. This is the way Wallach described those sessions: “Reggie was positive from day one. Regardless of whether I felt I was having a bad day and was struggling, ④ <u>he</u>’d find something good about what happened. You just don’t see that often. People tend to work off the negatives, but Reggie wouldn’t do that, and he wouldn’t let me do it either.” Wallach finished the year with twenty-three home runs and a .280 batting average. ⑤ <u>He</u> gave all the credit to Reggie Smith’s coaching and encouraging words.
