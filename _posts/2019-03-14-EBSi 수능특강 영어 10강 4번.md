And for this reason ② he did not wish him to learn Latin till he was twelve years of age, when he might easily acquire it. In the meantime, ③ he sought to give him a general idea of grammar — of its rules, and the exceptions to which these rules are liable — and so to fit him to take up the study of any language with intelligence and facility. He endeavoured further to direct ④ his son’s attention to the more marked phenomena of nature, and such explanations as he could give of them. But here the son’s perception outstripped the father’s power of explanation. ⑤ He wished to know the reason of everything; and when his father’s statements did not appear to him to give the reason, he was far from satisfied.
