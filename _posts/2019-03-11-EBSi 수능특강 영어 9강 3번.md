## (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Solar power and wind power are considered alternatives to fossil-fuel-based energy generation from coal, petroleum, and natural gas, which predominate worldwide energy production at the start of the 21st century. Both of them (A) `solve / cause`  what is seen as the most prevalent negative consequence of fossil-fuel-based energy generation: air pollution. This includes air pollution from chemicals, particulate matter[^1], organic compounds, toxic materials, and the emissions that lead to climate change. Solar power and wind power are also popular because they are renewable sources of energy production and so do not suffer the negative consequence of (B) `diminishing / increasing`  supplies. They are also domestic sources of energy production and so are not dependent on imports from what may be hostile countries. Finally, solar power and wind power have the technical capability to be distributed, meaning they are what is sometimes referred to as decentralized energy generation sources. They can be placed on individual homes and in small areas and do not rely on large, single generation stations that can be subject to large- scale blackouts, terrorist attacks, or other (C) `centralized / decentralized` vulnerabilities[^2]. 



[^1]: particulate&nbsp;matter 입자상 물질(대기 중에 떠다니는 고체 또는 액체 상태의 미세 입자)
[^2]: vulnerability 취약성
